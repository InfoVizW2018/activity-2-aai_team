# Activity 2 Marking Rubrik  83.5/100

## Describe the SeaSpan "Visualization Challenge"  61/75

### What?  25/25

### Why?  23/25

The visualization you are designing are not for presenting information to the client (that is not part of the scope of challenge).  It's for the client to use to better understand the data.

### How?  14/25

#### Assumptions  0/7
No assumptions were discussed.

#### Preliminary Design  10/11

Nice design and you cover most the attribute described in the "What" section but it is unclear how this design will help Seaspan to gain insights into the their schedule for better manual control.  

You should use the vessels' names in the visualization to make identification easier.

The visualization could be more geographically accurate to allow user to build a better mental model of a vessel's location

#### Justification  4/7

Justification of your design decisions needs work.  It should be clear how your design decisions are related to your descriptions in the "Why" section.

## Using The Design Study Methodology  22.5/25

### Applying the Design Study Methodology  10/12.5

How would you use the methodology if you were actually working on this project with Seaspan?

### Study Pitfalls  12.5/12.5
